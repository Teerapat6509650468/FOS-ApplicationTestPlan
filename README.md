# Faculty of Science Application Submission System - Test Plan

## Overview

This project contains a comprehensive test plan for the Faculty of Science application submission system. It focuses on automated end-to-end testing using Protractor, Selenium WebDriver, Mocha, and Chai, aiming to ensure performance, reliability, and minimal defects with 80% code coverage.

## Technologies Used

- **Protractor**: An end-to-end testing framework specifically designed for Angular and AngularJS applications.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: A tool for automating web browsers, used for creating and running end-to-end tests.
- **Mocha**: A JavaScript test framework that runs tests asynchronously and supports various assertions and test runners.
- **Chai**: An assertion library that works with Mocha, providing a variety of assertion styles for validating expected outcomes.

## Features

1. **Automated End-to-End Testing**: Ensures that the application behaves as expected in real-world scenarios.
2. **Performance Testing**: Validates that the application meets performance benchmarks.
3. **Reliability**: Ensures that the application functions consistently without failures.
4. **Code Coverage**: Aims to achieve 80% code coverage across the entire system.
5. **Minimal Defects**: Focuses on identifying and resolving defects early in the testing process.

## Test Strategy

1. **Functional Tests**: Ensure that all functional aspects of the Faculty of Science submission system work as expected.
2. **Performance Tests**: Validate response times and resource usage during peak load conditions.
3. **Regression Tests**: Automatically re-run all tests after updates to ensure no new issues are introduced.
4. **Usability Tests**: Check the user interface to ensure ease of use and consistency.
